    <h1>Understanding Web Browsers</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Introduction to Browsers</h2>
        <p><strong>What is a web browser?</strong> A web browser is a program that helps you access information on the
            internet, like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.</p>
        <p><strong>Why are browsers important?</strong> They let you see websites by interpreting code like HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript.</p>
        <p><strong>How have browsers changed?</strong> They've gotten faster and added more features, like playing
            videos or keeping your info safe.</p>

        <h2>How a Browser Works</h2>
        <p><strong>How does a browser show a webpage?</strong> When you type in a web address (URL), the browser asks
            the internet for the page, gets the code, and then shows it to you.</p>
        <p><strong>Why do web standards matter?</strong> They make sure all browsers show websites the same way, so you
            always see what you expect.</p>

            <li>Google might save some of your info</li>

        <h2>Privacy Concerns and Solutions</h2>
        <p><strong>What are cookies?</strong> Cookies are bits of data stored on your computer by websites. They can
            remember things about you, like your login info.</p>
        <p><strong>Are cookies safe?</strong> Some people worry about cookies from ads that follow you around. Most
            browsers now let you stop this.</p>


        <h2>How a Browser Views a Webpage</h2>
        <p><strong>How does a browser read a webpage?</strong> It reads the code (like HTML), looks at how things should
            look (like with CSS), and then shows you buttons, pictures, and text.</p>
